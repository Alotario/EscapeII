A new installation of the Escape! series, Escape II will be a complete overhaul of the Escape concept. Since the first game was so boring and challengeless, we plan to rework the entire game concept from the ground up, adding health, enemies, and easier puzzles for those who had trouble with them in the first game.

Utilizing our new Topside Engine, we plan to make Escape II the biggest, most overhauled game we have ever made. It will be one of our biggest projects yet, so stay tuned here for the latest updates!

Escape II has a planned release window of late 2023 or early 2024. This game is a passion-based project, so it will take quite a bit of time to come out.
